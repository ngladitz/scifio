/**
 * A proxy capable of bidirectional communication of biological image data to
 * and from a particular storage medium.
 *
 * <p>The <code>IMetadata</code> interface is a shorthand for a metadata
 * storage implementation that handles both storage (see {@link MetadataStore})
 * and retrieval (see {@link MetadataRetrieve}) of metadata fields. It exists
 * mainly to reduce the need to cast between <code>MetadataStore</code> and
 * <code>MetadataRetrieve</code> object types.
